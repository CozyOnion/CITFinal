One player thinks of a word or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Usually this is played on paper and pencil, but this is an electronic version. In this online version, a word will be automatically generated for the player to guess.</p></div></section><section class="htplay"><div class="content-wrap"><h2 id="two">How to Play</h2><p>1. The host, in this case the computer, will generate a random word. Blank lines will appear to indicate how many letters are in the word.</p><p>2. The player will start guessing letters that they think make up the word. Note that they do not have unlimited tries.</p><p>3. Whenever the player guesses a correct letter, the computer will automatically put down in the blank spaces where that letter is in the word. If there are multiples of the guessed letter, the computer will also reveal it.</p><p>4. If you guess a letter that is not in the word, the stick figure will slowly start to appear. For the first time wrong, the head will appear. The second time, the body will show up, Then the arms, legs, etc. When the man has fully appeared, that means you have lost.</p><p>5. If you have guessed the word correctly, then you have won that round. A new word will appear after for you yo try again.</p></div><noscript><strong>We're sorry but hangman doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled.
